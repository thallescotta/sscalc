## About
OpenCPU implementation of my main Sample Size Calculator at https://wnarifin.github.io/ssc_web.html

This is implemented for the sample size calculators for Structural Equation Modeling using RMSEA and CFI.

As these requires accurate implementation of Ding's algorithm to calculate noncentral chi-squared distribution (then noncentrality parameter ncp for given df using Kim's algorithm), it relies on qchisq() in R. Javascript implementation of Ding's algorithm cannot handle large df.

I use opencpu as an alternative to Shiny, which I find quite slow to load.

Please find the available functions in `R/ss_sem_fun.R`, and the examples in `R/ss_sem_examples.R`. I will write a proper manual / documentation later.
